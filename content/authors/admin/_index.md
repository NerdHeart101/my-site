I am a student studying technical communications and computer science at Texas Tech University. 

I use to work in IT for Lubbock-Cooper ISD, where I primarily worked on Apple device deployments. Now I am an assistant for the TTU WCOE STEM outreach and engagement program, where I assist with activates such as FIRST, BEST, and GEAR.

I have been involved with FIRST for six years, as a student, mentor, and volunteer!
